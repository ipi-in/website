Naturally termites are not a pest and their recycling of wood and other plant matter is of considerable ecological importance. It is only when they get into our house and start damaging its structure and wood; we consider them to be a pest.<br />
<br />
Termites are sometimes called &quot;white ants&quot;, though they are not closely related to true ants. There are two phases in the termite control programme:<br />
1. Pre-construction programmed (For New Structures)<br />
2. Post construction programmed (After Construction)<br />
Pre-construction programmed:<br />
Stage 1 (during foundation): Treat the bottom and the sides up to a height of about 30 cms of foundation spraying the formulated chemical per Sq. meter surface area.<br />
Stage 2 (after completion of foundation): On both sides of the built-up walls treat the refill earth (width 30 cms and height 40 cms) per linear meter.<br />
Stage 3 (before lying of floor): Before sand bed and slab is laid on the floor, treat the top surface of the entire grayed and leveled earth within the plinth wall.<br />
Stage 4 (after completion of building): Treat the earth along the external perimeter of the building per linear meter. Wherever pipes and conduits enter the soil, loosen the soil for a distance of 15 to 7.5 cms deep and thoroughly drench it with the formulated chemical.<br />
Guarantee Period: For Pre-construction the Guarantee period will be 10 years post construction programmed:<br />
<br />
Stage 1: Treatment to wall and floor junction: Holes of 8mm diameter 18-20 inches apart will be drilled along the inner junction of wall and floor at depth of 6&#39;&#39;on the entire ground Termiticide solution will be injected under pressure into these holes to create barrier against termites.<br />
<br />
Stage 2: Treatment to wooden fixtures: Holes of 12mm diameter will be drilled at the base of wooden-fixtures such as window frames and doorframes adjoining the flooring and termiticide solution will be injected. This treatment will be carried out on all floors (except basements/Terrace). An oil-based termiticide will be sprayed on all the woodwork infested by the termites within the premises. Special care will be taken in case furniture attached to the wall as the termites can easily attack them. Drilling will be carried out at the base of all such fixture and termiticide solution will be injected.<br />
<br />
Stage 3: Treatment to termite tubes: Visible shelter mud tubes are first sprayed, to control the existing movement of termites. The mud tube will be then removed and treatment will be given to the infested area.<br />
<br />
Guarantee Period: For Post-construction the Guarantee period will be 5 years.<br />
